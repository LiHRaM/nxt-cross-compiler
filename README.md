# Summary
Putting nxtOSEK files on a Lego NXT is an arduous process, mostly due to outdated guides and file references.
I've put together this cross-compiler in a docker container, for a guaranteed repeatable cross-compilation.

See http://lejos-osek.sourceforge.net/ for more information on nxtOSEK.

I've only tested this on the Extended Standard Firmware, but this should work fine for ROM-only and no firmware as well.
